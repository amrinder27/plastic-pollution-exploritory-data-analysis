# Global Pollution Data Analysis

## Date

April 2021

## Project Description

Performed comprehensive data cleaning techniques to obtain a refined and processed data set, resulting in realistic counts of plastic garbage collected.

Utilized various data visualization techniques, such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, to compare and contrast the count of plastic garbage in different countries and provide insights into the distribution of the data.

Reported accurate interval estimations for multiple means, ratios, and proportions to better understand the true population parameters of the collected data.

Conducted a rigorous Welch Two Sample t-test to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in the average amount of plastic pollution produced in the years 2019 and 2020, providing critical insights into the trends of plastic pollution.
